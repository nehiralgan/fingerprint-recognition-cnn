**Fingerprint Recognition System
Hybrid Fingerprint Matching with CNN & Classical Vision**

This repository implements a hybrid fingerprint recognition system that combines:
Convolutional Neural Network (Siamese CNN) for learned similarity
Minutiae extraction & matching for structural fingerprint features
Liveness detection to reject fake fingerprints
Visualization tools for matched minutiae and decision explanation

The system processes fingerprint images, computes similarity scores, and produces human-interpretable match visualizations.

**Note:** If you want to see example outputs or visual results, check the screenshots/ directory or generate via running the system.

**General Information**

Fingerprint recognition is essential in biometric authentication. This system:
Preprocesses fingerprint images (binarization, skeletonization)
Extracts minutiae points (ridge endings & bifurcations)
Computes structural similarity via point matching
Computes embedding similarity via a Siamese CNN
Fuses scores for robust identity decision
Detects liveness (points to potential spoof fingerprints)
Visualizes matched features (top strongest matches)
This hybrid approach improves accuracy and interpretability compared to single-method systems.

**Features
Feature Extraction**

Skeletonization of fingerprint patterns
Local orientation & density scoring
Ending and bifurcation detection

**Liveness Detection**

Rejects fakes based on texture & frequency analysis

**Score Fusion and Decision Logic**

Weighted fusion:
final_score = 0.4 × CNN_score + 0.6 × Minutiae_score
Ambiguity margin controls uncertain decisions
Thresholding for acceptance / rejection

**Visualization**

Two separate windows showing matched minutiae
Top-20 strongest matches numbered and color-coded

**Requirements**

Ensure you have Python 3.10+, then create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

Dependencies include:

OpenCV    
PyTorch
scikit-image
SciPy

**Training the CNN**

To train the fingerprint similarity model:

cd cnn
python train.py

This will produce a model file (e.g., siamese_fingerprint.pth).
Note: Model weights are not included in the repository.

**Running Recognition**

To run the full recognition pipeline:

python main.py

Output will include:
Liveness score
Scores for each enrolled person
Final decision (Accepted / Ambiguous / Rejected)
Visualization of matched minutiae points

**How It Works (Technical Summary)
Minutiae Matching**

Minutiae points are extracted and filtered. Matched pairs are found between test and reference prints. Top matched pairs show structural similarity.

**Siamese CNN**

Pairs of fingerprint images are embedded into a learned space. 
Similarity is computed as:

score = 1 / (1 + euclidean_distance)

**Score Fusion & Decision**

Final system decision is based on:
Weighted combination of CNN and structural scores
Threshold for valid identity
Gap margin to avoid ambiguous decisions
This design balances learned patterns and structural features.

**Use Cases**

Biometric authentication research
Academic demonstration of hybrid matching
Fingerprint liveness evaluation
Visual demonstration of matching

**Limitations**

Dataset is small — model accuracy is limited
CPU-only inference — slower than GPU
Not for production security systems
This project is for learning, experimentation, and prototyping.
